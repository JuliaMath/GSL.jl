# This function returns a pointer to a structure that contains the lookup table
# for the discrete random number generator.  The array P[] contains the
# probabilities of the discrete events; these array elements must all be
# positive, but they needn't add up to one (so you can think of them more
# generally as “weights”)—the preprocessor will normalize appropriately.  This
# return value is used as an argument for the gsl_ran_discrete function below.
#
#   Returns: Ptr{gsl_ran_discrete_t}

# After the preprocessor, above, has been called, you use this function to get
# the discrete random numbers.
#
#   Returns: Csize_t
function ran_discrete(r::Ref{gsl_rng}, g::Ref{gsl_ran_discrete_t})

end


# Returns the probability P[k] of observing the variable k.  Since P[k] is not
# stored as part of the lookup table, it must be recomputed; this computation
# takes O(K), so if K is large and you care about the original array P[k] used
# to create the lookup table, then you should just keep this original array
# P[k] around.
#
#   Returns: Cdouble

#   Returns: Void
