export bspline_deriv_eval, bspline_deriv_eval_nonzero


# This function evaluates all B-spline basis function derivatives of orders 0
# through nderiv (inclusive) at the position x and stores them in the matrix
# dB.  The (i,j)-th element of dB is d^jB_i(x)/dx^j.  The matrix dB must be of
# size n = nbreak + k - 2 by nderiv + 1.  The value n may also be obtained by
# calling gsl_bspline_ncoeffs.  Note that function evaluations are included as
# the zeroth order derivatives in dB.  Computing all the basis function
# derivatives at once is more efficient than computing them individually, due
# to the nature of the defining recurrence relation.
# 
#   Returns: Cint

# This function evaluates all potentially nonzero B-spline basis function
# derivatives of orders 0 through nderiv (inclusive) at the position x and
# stores them in the matrix dB.  The (i,j)-th element of dB is  d^j/dx^j
# B_(istart+i)(x).  The last row of dB contains  d^j/dx^j B_(iend)(x).  The
# matrix dB must be of size k by at least nderiv + 1.  Note that function
# evaluations are included as the zeroth order derivatives in dB.  By returning
# only the nonzero basis functions, this function allows quantities involving
# linear combinations of the B_i(x) and their derivatives to be computed
# without unnecessary terms.
