# This function provides random variates from the upper tail of a Gaussian
# distribution with standard deviation sigma.  The values returned are larger
# than the lower limit a, which must be positive.  The method is based on
# Marsaglia's famous rectangle-wedge-tail algorithm (Ann.  Math. Stat. 32,
# 894â€“899 (1961)), with this aspect explained in Knuth, v2, 3rd ed, p139,586
# (exercise 11).          The probability distribution for Gaussian tail random
# variates is,                 p(x) dx = {1 \over N(a;\sigma) \sqrt{2 \pi
# \sigma^2}} \exp (- x^2/(2 \sigma^2)) dx  for x > a where N(a;\sigma) is the
# normalization constant,                 N(a;\sigma) = (1/2) erfc(a / sqrt(2
# sigma^2)).

# This function computes the probability density p(x) at x for a Gaussian tail
# distribution with standard deviation sigma and lower limit a, using the
# formula given above.

# They are equivalent to the functions above with a standard deviation of one,
# sigma = 1.
